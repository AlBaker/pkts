# About SIP

# What "About SIP" contains

Currently, About SIP contains the following two libraries:

* aboutsip-buffers - yet another java buffer implementation inspired by netty.io. This implementation is 100% standalone and is only dependent on java 6
* yajpcap - yet another java pcap library, which provides a library in pure java for reading pcap files and the only dependency is on aboutsip-buffers.

To get more information, please see the readme file under each of the sub-projects

# Get Started

Everything within About SIP is following the general guidelines of Maven so if you are familiar with Maven you should have no problem getting started. Currently, none of the projects within About SIP exists in any public maven repository so for now you will have to build it yourself, something that should be fast and easy.

## Build it

1. Clone it
1. cd aboutsip/modules
1. mvn install
1. done
